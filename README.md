## Why

- I love Halloween ðŸŽƒ
- Side projects are the best
- ~~Given how hectic 2020 is, I believe kids won't have a normal Halloween. I want try to produce more smiles from the kids in my neighborhood.~~
- Let's give people a reason to smile every year.

## What does it do

It allows anyone to change the color of the lighting behind the witch silhouette curtain

Here's what the front of my house looks like:

## How does it work

1. Uses [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) as a reverse proxy to the `witch` app for TLS termination([let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).
2. The `witch` app is a Go backend powered by [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) that serves a vanilla html/css/js front end and has a `/color/:color` route.
3. Once a `/color/:color` route is hit via a `POST` request, the `witch` app uses the [huego](https://github.com/amimof/huego) library for manipulating the state of the philips hue multicolor bulbs. The hue bridge endpoint on your network is automatically discovered.
4. When a `/sound/:sound` route is hit via a `POST` request, the `witch` app writes to an in-memory queue which will then process sounds to play by calling the [assistant-relay](https://assistantrelay.com) to play pre-configured halloween sounds through connected nest speakers. The reason for the queue is to ensure all sounds are played and do not overlap.
