## Why

- I love Halloween ðŸŽƒ
- Side projects are the best
- ~~Given how hectic 2020 is, I believe kids won't have a normal Halloween. I want try to produce more smiles from the kids in my neighborhood.~~
- Let's give people a reason to smile every year.

## What does it do

It allows anyone to change the color of the lighting behind the witch silhouette curtain

Here's what the front of my house looks like:

## How does it work

1. Uses [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) as a reverse proxy to the `witch` app for TLS termination([let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).
2. The `witch` app is a Go backend powered by [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) that serves a vanilla html/css/js front end and has a `/color/:color` route.
3. Once a `/color/:color` route is hit via a `POST` request, the `witch` app uses the [huego](https://github.com/amimof/huego) library for manipulating the state of the philips hue multicolor bulbs. The hue bridge endpoint on your network is automatically discovered.
4. When a `/sound/:sound` route is hit via a `POST` request, the `witch` app writes to an in-memory queue which will then process sounds to play by calling the [assistant-relay](https://assistantrelay.com) to play pre-configured halloween sounds through connected nest speakers. The reason for the queue is to ensure all sounds are played and do not overlap.

### Go

```bash
go build -o witch .
export WITCH_HUE_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>; export WITCH_HUE_LIGHTS="1,2,3"; export WITCH_ASSISTANT_DEVICE="My speaker"
./witch
```

### Docker

#### Deploy

> Be sure to update values in `.env` to be consumed by `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Build

```bash
# Auto determine CPU arch
make build-docker
# ARM64
make build-docker-arm64
# ARMv7
make build-docker-armv7
```

### Terraform module

Colors + sounds are not mutually exclusive, you can pass either just a color, just a sound, or both.

```hcl
module "witchonstephendrive" {
  source       = "github.com/circa10a/witchonstephendrive.com//terraform"
  api_base_url = "https://witchonstephendrive.com/api/v1"
  color        = "purple"
  sound        = "stranger-things"
}

output "color_change_response" {
  value = module.witchonstephendrive.color_change_response
}

output "supported_colors" {
  value = module.witchonstephendrive.supported_colors
}

output "sound_play_response" {
  value = module.witchonstephendrive.sound_play_response
}

output "supported_sounds" {
  value = module.witchonstephendrive.supported_sounds
}
```
