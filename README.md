A home automation project to control hue lights for Halloween <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egonelbre/gophers/10cc13c5e29555ec23f689dc985c157a8d4692ab/vector/fairy-tale/witch-too-much-candy.svg" align="right"/>

## Why

- I love Halloween
- Side projects are the best
- Given how hectic 2020 is, I believe kids won't have a normal Halloween, therefore I want try to produce more smiles from the kids in my neighborhood.

## What's it do?
